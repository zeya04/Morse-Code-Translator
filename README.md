# Morse-Code-Translator

An easy-to-use programme that can transform your regular text—including letters, numbers, and unique symbols—into an encrypted morse code. Additionally, it can decipher your morse code into regular text.

<b><u> MORSE CODE </u></b>

Morse code is a system for communicating in which regular text is changed into a series of on/off tones, lights/clicks, or dots/dashes that may be decoded by an expert. It honours Samuel F. B. Morse, the telegraph's namesake and inventor.

<b>ALGORITHM FOR MORSE CODE TRANSLATOR</b>

Even the algorithm for translating morse code is straightforward. To do this, we've had to change every letter of the alphabet into its equivalent combination of dots and dashes, or just dots or dashes, and vice versa.

<b>MODULES USED</b>

1. Morse Code Dictionary.py  :- To facilitate the translation, this component provides a morse code dictionary with matching key and value pairs.
2. Encryption.py  :- This module contains a function for converting standard text to morse code.
3. Decryption.py  :- TThis module's function converts morse code to regular text.
4. Graphics.py         :- This is the module where the code can be executed using a simple GUI.
5. Graphics_support.py :- This module uses try and except to import the correct library and display the GUI.
6. Main.py         :- This module is concerned with GUI code execution. For the sake of simplicity, it is terminal-based.
